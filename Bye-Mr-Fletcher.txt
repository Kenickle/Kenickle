Dear mr fletcher,

Thank you for all of your computing
lessons! I have learned so much about
scratch and concepts in coding from
you! You are amazing and I hope year
5 have as much of a fun experience
as I did using the iPads!

Note: I will upload all of my projects on this github page!!!

Thank you so so much - Kenny! ðŸ˜‹
